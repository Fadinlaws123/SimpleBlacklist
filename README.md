# SimpleBlacklist v1.0.0 Release

***

## üì∞ About SimpleBlacklist

* *SimpleBlacklist is a multi-blacklist script that comes with the ability to blacklist: vehicles, weapons, and player peds. It's very __simple__ to setup.*

## ‚ùì How to setup SimpleBlacklist

1. *SimpleBlacklist comes with only 1 file you have to edit, with this being said open up the `Config.lua` file and then navigate to the main area.*
2. *Starting out, you have the option to disable / enable any feature you want that comes with SimpleBlacklist.*
   * *"VehicleBlacklist = true"*
   * *"WeaponBlacklist = true"*
   * *"PedBlacklist = true"*
3. *Despite which options you have enabled, or disabled will vary with which options you edit will change the script functionality; scrolling down you should see sections that list off different functions, Vehicles, Peds, and Weapons. In order to add / remove something from the list that the script searches for, you would have to add the SPAWN NAME for each area. For example, if I wanted to add a police cruiser to the list of vehicles to be blacklisted, I would add __"police"__ to the list of cars to be blacklisted. Same for the peds, and weapons, just add the spawn names.*
4. *Restart the resource and it should take effects with whatever weapons, peds, or vehicles you've added to the list.*

## ‚ùó Notice

* *If you added more than 1 line to each section of the blacklist, make sure you add a comma (,) at the end of each line; for example: "police", this way the script knows to read more after the line you put, however, if there is no comma the script will assume that the ending on the list to read from ended there and will close the function.*
